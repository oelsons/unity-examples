# Unity Examples

## Door
Even a simple door can be tricky if you're just starting gamedev!
So I created this example to see how much stuff you can learn by just having a door in your game.
Just the bare minimum: A door and buttons.

For this simple door, you'll encounter:
- Communication between GameObjects
- Collisions / Triggers
- Quaternions
- Lerp
- Lists
- Events
- Interaction
- Rigidbody
- Player Controller

Also I've made sure to only use in-Unity stuff, no external assets.
